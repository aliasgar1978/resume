=================================================



Execution Steps - summary (common)
----------------------------------------------

	#. Import project module
	#. Define Inputs
		* Authentication parameters
		* List of all eligible devices
		* List of all commands to be captured (model wise)
		* Output path
	#. execute

Execution Steps - Explained (common)
----------------------------------------------

	#. Import the necessary module::

		from capture_it import capture


	#. Authentication Parameters::

		# Provide Authentication Parameters in a dictionary as below.
		auth = {
			'un':'provide username' , 
			'pw':'provide login password', 
			'en':'provide enable password'  
		}
		## Make sure to use static passwords. Refrain using OTP, as ID may get locked due to multiple simultaneous login.


	#. List of devices::

		# Option 1:  Provide the list of devices as below.
		devices = [
			'192.168.1.1',
			'10.10.10.1',
			# ... list down all ip addresses for which output to be captured  
		]

		# Option 2:  Store list of devices IP in a text file and get from that file.
		with open('devices.txt', 'r') as f:
			lns = f.readlines()
		devices = [_.strip() for _ in lns]


	#. Output path::

		op_path = './captures/'

	#. Commands to be captured::

		# Option 1:  Provide the list of Commands as below.
		CISCO_IOS_CMDS = 	[
			'sh run', 
			'sh int status', 
			'sh lldp nei',
			# .. edit as need  
		]
		JUNIPER_JUNOS_CMDS = [
			'show configuration | no-more',
			'show lldp neighbors | no-more',
			'show interfaces descriptions | no-more',
			# .. edit as need 
		]

		# Option 2:  Store list of commands in a text file and get from that file.
		with open('cisco_commands.txt', 'r') as f:
			lns = f.readlines()
		CISCO_IOS_CMDS = [_.strip() for _ in lns]
		with open('juniper_commands.txt', 'r') as f:
			lns = f.readlines()
		JUNIPER_JUNOS_CMDS = [_.strip() for _ in lns]

		# After commands lists available, add it to a dictionary as below..
		cmds = {
			'cisco_ios'  : CISCO_IOS_CMDS,
			'juniper_junos': JUNIPER_JUNOS_CMDS, 
		}


		Note: ``arista_eos`` key for the Arista switches commands list to be added to dictionary.



	#. Start Capturing::

		capture(devices,				## List of devices 
			auth, 		## Authentication parameters (dict)
			cmds, 		## Dictionary of list of commands ( see above example )
			op_path,	## output path - to store the outputs. 
			cumulative=True, 	## True/False/Both (store output in a single file, individual command file, both)
			forced_login=False, 	## True/False (True: try to ssh/login device even if ping responce fails. )
			parsed_output=False,	## True/False (True: Evaluate and parse the command outputs to store device data in excel)
			concurrent_connections=100, 	## numeric value (default:100), number of simultaneous device connections in a group. 
		)


.. important::
	
	``Parameters``

	* *devices* = list of ip addresses
	* *auth* = authentication Parameters
	* *cmds* = dictionary of list of commands to be captred (cisco, juniper, arista).
	* *op_path* = output path ( use "." for storing in same relative folder )
	* *cumulative* = (Options: True, False, 'Both') defines how to store each command output. True=Save all output in a single file. False=Save all command output in individual file. 'Both'=will generate both kinds of output.
	* *forced_login* = (Options: True, False) (Default: False)  Forced login to device even if device ping doesn't succeded.
	* *parsed_output* = (Options: True, False) (Default: False) Parse the command output and generates device database in excel file.  Each command output try to generate a pased detail tab.
	* *concurrent_connections* = (numeric) (Default: 100), change the number of simultaneous device connections as per link connection and your pc cpu processng performance.

	Since we are providing all commands at a time for all devices, Script will automatically identifies whether device is ``Cisco/Juniper/Arista`` and push respective commands to the system without needing to mention explicitly.

Watch out for the terminal if any errors and see your output in given output path.
